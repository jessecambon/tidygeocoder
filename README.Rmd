Tidygeocoder makes getting data from geocoder services easy. A unified high-level interface is provided for a selection of [supported geocoder services](https://jessecambon.github.io/tidygeocoder/articles/geocoder_services.html) and results are returned in [tibble](https://tibble.tidyverse.org/) (dataframe) format.

**Features:**

- Forward geocoding (addresses ⮕ coordinates)
- Reverse geocoding (coordinates ⮕ addresses)
- Batch geocoding (geocoding multiple addresses or coordinates in a single query) is automatically used if applicable.
- Duplicate, NA, and blank input data is handled elegantly; only unique inputs are submitted in queries, but the rows in the original data are preserved by default.
- The maximum rate of querying is automatically set according to the usage policies of the selected geocoder service.

In addition to the usage examples below, see the [Getting Started Vignette](https://jessecambon.github.io/tidygeocoder/articles/tidygeocoder.html) and [blog posts on tidygeocoder](https://jessecambon.github.io/tag/tidygeocoder).

## Installation

To install the stable version from CRAN (the official R package servers):

```{r, eval=F}
install.packages('tidygeocoder')
```

Alternatively, you can install the latest development version from GitHub:

```{r, eval=F}
devtools::install_github("jessecambon/tidygeocoder")
```

## Usage

In this first example we will geocode a few addresses using the `geocode()` function and plot them on a map with ggplot.

```{r, warning = F, message = F}
library(dplyr)
library(tibble)
library(tidygeocoder)

# create a dataframe with addresses
some_addresses <- tribble(
~name,                  ~addr,
"White House",          "1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW, Washington, DC",
"Transamerica Pyramid", "600 Montgomery St, San Francisco, CA 94111",     
"Willis Tower",         "233 S Wacker Dr, Chicago, IL 60606"                                  
)

# geocode the addresses
lat_longs <- some_addresses %>%
  geocode(addr, method = 'osm', lat = latitude , long = longitude)
```

The `geocode()` function geocodes addresses contained in a dataframe. The [Nominatim ("osm")](https://nominatim.org/) geocoder service is used here, but other services can be specified with the `method` argument. Only latitude and longitude are returned from the geocoder service in this example, but `full_results = TRUE` can be used to return all of the data from the geocoder service. See the `geo()` function documentation for details.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::kable(lat_longs)
```

Now that we have the longitude and latitude coordinates, we can use ggplot to plot our addresses on a map.

```{r usamap}
library(ggplot2)
library(maps)
library(ggrepel)

ggplot(lat_longs, aes(longitude, latitude), color = "grey99") +
  borders("state") + geom_point() +
  geom_label_repel(aes(label = name)) +
  theme_void()
```

To perform reverse geocoding (obtaining addresses from geographic coordinates), we can use the `reverse_geocode()` function. The arguments are similar to the `geocode()` function, but now we specify the input data columns with the `lat` and `long` arguments. The dataset used here is from the geocoder query above. The single line address is returned in a column named by the `address` argument and all columns from the geocoder service are returned because `full_results = TRUE`. See the `reverse_geo()` function documentation for more details.

<!-- 
Removing the licence column is done just to prevent a note from 
occurring in automated CRAN checks for an improper/old link.
-->
```{r}
reverse <- lat_longs %>%
  reverse_geocode(lat = latitude, long = longitude, method = 'osm',
                  address = address_found, full_results = TRUE) %>%
  select(-addr, -licence)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::kable(reverse)
```

## In the Wild

For inspiration, here are a few articles (with code) that leverage tidygeocoder:

- [Exercises: Spatial Data Wrangling with sf](http://www2.stat.duke.edu/courses/Spring21/sta323.001/exercises/lec_12.html) - part of a [statistical computing course](http://www2.stat.duke.edu/courses/Spring21/sta323.001/) at Duke.
- [Mapping a network of women in demography](https://www.monicaalexander.com/posts/2021-21-02-mapping/) - using rvest and tidygeocoder to map Google Scholar data.
